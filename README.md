# Quick Start

## Installation

The following goes over the recommended installation process using pipx to avoid any dependency conflicts.

GraphSpy is built to work on every operating system, although it was mainly tested on Linux and Windows. 

For other installation options and detailed instructions, check the [Installation page](https://github.com/RedByte1337/GraphSpy/wiki/Installation) on the wiki.

```bash
# Install pipx (skip this if you already have it)
apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install the latest version of GraphSpy from pypi
pipx install graphspy
```

## Execution

After installation, the application can be launched using the `graphspy` command from any location on the system.

Running GraphSpy without any command line arguments will launch GraphSpy and make it available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

```bash
graphspy
```

Now simply open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your favorite browser to get started!

Use the `-i` and `-p` arguments to modify the interface and port to listen on.

```bash
# Run GraphSpy on http://192.168.0.10
graphspy -i 192.168.0.10 -p 80
# Run GraphSpy on port 8080 on all interfaces
graphspy -i 0.0.0.0 -p 8080
```

For detailed instructions and other command line arguments, please refer to the [Execution page](https://github.com/RedByte1337/GraphSpy/wiki/Execution) on the wiki.

## Usage

Please refer to the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/RedByte1337/GraphSpy/wiki) for full usage details.

# Features

## Access and Refresh Tokens

Store your access and refresh tokens for multiple users and scopes in one location. 

![Access Tokens](images/access_tokens_1.png)

![Refresh Tokens](images/refresh_tokens.png)

Easily switch between them or request new access tokens from any page.

![Token Side Bar](images/token_side_bar_1.png)

## Device Codes

Easily create and poll multiple device codes at once. If a user used the device code to authenticate, GraphSpy will automatically store the access and refresh token in its database.

![Device Codes](images/device_codes.png)

## MFA Methods

View, modify and create MFA methods linked to the account of the user.

![MFA Methods Overview](images/mfa_methods_overview.png)

The following MFA methods can be added from GraphSpy to set up persistance:
- Microsoft Authenticator App
- Custom OTP App, or use GraphSpy as OTP app to generate TOTP codes on the fly!
- FIDO Security Keys!
- Alternative email address
- Mobile/Office/Alternative Phones (SMS or call)

![MFA Methods FIDO](images/mfa_methods_fido.png)

## Files and SharePoint

Browse through files and folders in the user's OneDrive or any accessible SharePoint site through an intuitive file explorer interface.

Of course, files can also be directly downloaded, or new files can be uploaded.

![OneDrive](images/onedrive_2.png)

Additionally, list the user's recently accessed files or files shared with the user.

![Recent Files](images/recent_files.png)

## Outlook

Open the user's Outlook web mail with a single click using just an Outlook access token (FOCI)!

![Outlook GraphSpy](images/outlook_1.png)

![Outlook](images/outlook_2.png)

Or use the Outlook Graph module to list, read, search, delete, reply or send emails with just an access token for the MS Graph API!

![Outlook Graph Overview](images/outlook_graph_overview.png)

Craft completely HTML formated emails directly in GraphSpy and include images and attachments.

![Outlook Graph Overview](images/outlook_graph_send_email.png)

## MS Teams

Read and send messages using the Microsoft Teams module with a FOCI access token of the skype API (https://api.spaces.skype.com/).

![MS Teams GraphSpy](images/ms_teams.png)

## Graph Searching

Search for keywords through all Microsoft 365 applications using the Microsoft Search API.

For instance, use this to search for any files or emails containing keywords such as "password", "secret", ...

![Graph Search](images/graph_search_2.png)

## Custom Requests

Perform custom API requests towards any endpoint using access tokens stored in GraphSpy.

![Custom Request](images/custom_requests.png)

Custom request templates with variables can be stored in the database to allow easy reuse of common custom API requests.

![Custom Request](images/custom_request_templates.png)

## Entra ID

List all Entra ID users and their properties using the Microsoft Graph API.

![Entra Users Overview](images/entra_users_overview.png)

View additional details for a user, such as its group memberships, role assignments, devices, app roles and API permissions.

![Entra Users Details](images/entra_users_details_1.png)

## Multiple Databases

GraphSpy supports multiple databases. This is useful when working on multiple assessments at once to keep your tokens and device codes organized.

![Graph Request](images/settings.png)

## Dark Mode

Use the dark mode by default, or switch to light mode.

# Credits

The main motivation for creating GraphSpy was the lack of an easy to use way to perform post-compromise activities targetting Office365 applications (such as Outlook, Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, ...) with just an access token.

While several command-line tools existed which provided some basic functionality, none of them came close to the intuitive interactive experience which the original applications provide (such as the file explorer-like interface of OneDrive and SharePoint).

However, a lot of previous research was done by countless other persons (specifically regarding Device Code Phishing, which lead to the initial requirement for such a tool in the first place).
